__The goal__

The goal of this repository is to show the way of proceeding with predicting the price of bitcoin.
It is rather impossible to precisely predict the price of bitcoin in short term. By precisely the author means that 
the model would allow for earning money based on speculation and trading. The repository is in progress and new notebooks will be added over time.

Files description:
- `RNN_BTC.ipynb` - a file where recurrent neural network (with LSTM layer) is built and all steps necessary for adjusting dataset for RNN are shown
